# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNNs
The project focuses on developing an automated pneumonia detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), applied to chest X-ray images. By utilizing the VGG-16 architecture with transfer learning, the system is designed to accurately classify images as either "Pneumonia" or "Normal." The workflow involves preprocessing the X-ray images, optimizing model parameters, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to ensure robust performance. The project emphasizes the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation. Additionally, the project includes the development of a user-friendly interface, allowing healthcare professionals to easily upload and analyze X-ray images for real-time diagnostics. By leveraging insights from existing literature and addressing common challenges in medical image analysis, the system aims to assist in early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia, particularly in resource-limited settings, with future plans for enhancing its effectiveness and accessibility.
